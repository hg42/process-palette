**JSON map vs. list:**

I would prefer an array.

Maintaining the file manually would be inconvenient, when saving  the same thing into two different structures (map for values and list for sequence).

I understand this breaks compatibility.
Migrating is unidirectional, going back to an older version would not work (I think this would be ok, if the user is notified).
We could also leave it as it is now (because it works) for some versions/time (hoping it doesn't break) and implement reading both variants. When later the config file is upgraded from the map to a list, going back would be possible in this range of versions.

**defaultPatterns:**

The whole reason to have default patterns is to always use the same patterns for all commands (that's how I always used this). Meaning no work for the usual case and some work for special cases.
I only created the setting "defaultPatterns" to have the same list as the commands use.
So, I think a selection of patterns is not necessary.

Additionally, the sequence mostly depends on the kind of patterns. It's a kind of priority list.
You could create patterns that don't conflict. But a priority list is simpler to understand and maintain.

**pattern selection in command editor**

For command configuration, in cases where a subset of patterns has to be used, I would probably use a simple string field with comma separated names.
An empty field means "use defaults", or you may use an additional checkbox to enable this field.
There could eventually be a button next to it (three dots?) with a popup multi-select list (or checkboxes) for the patterns you want (communicating bidirectional with the string value).

**file exist**

while using, I noticed that checking if a file exists doesn't work in all cases.
Depending on Add-Ons and configuration and the commands used, relative paths can refer to a project (or multiple projects!) or the location of the currently open file or may even be found in some search path (for libraries etc.).

It's generally not possible to resolve all these unambiguously.

That's because commands often depend on external configuration (you don't know) and the same relative path could exist below different base directories.

That said, it could be useful to scan at least:
* working directory of the command
* directory of current project
* directories of other loaded projects

because these can change between commands, it would probably be necessary to save these directories together with the output of the command. Some values could be simply saved in an email-header format at the top of an output. I think, this could even be visible in the pane.
