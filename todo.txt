TODO: defaultPatterns:

The whole reason to have default patterns is to always use the same patterns for all commands (that's how I always used this). Meaning no work for the usual case and some work for special cases.
I only created the setting "defaultPatterns" to have the same list as the commands use.
So, I think a selection of patterns is not necessary.

Additionally, the sequence mostly depends on the kind of patterns. It's a kind of priority list.
You could create patterns that don't conflict. But a priority list is simpler to understand and maintain.

TODO: pattern selection in command editor (drop it? use groups? words+popup-list?)

TODO: patterns-JSON: map -> list, migrate and popup message

TODO: .process-palette-output-panel does not work with padding etc. (resizer?)
